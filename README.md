## Folder Structure and Contents

### 1. `7150CEM_SAIANIRUDH_EN_DATA_CODE`  
This folder contains all English (EN) language related files including:  
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) implementing data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for the English dataset.  
- CSV data files used by the notebooks for training and testing the models.  
- Each notebook contains markdown cells describing its purpose and the associated CSV files it requires.

### 2. `7150CEM_SAIANIRUDH_TR_DATA_CODE`  
This folder contains all translated (TR) or related dataset files including:  
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments involving translated or alternative language data.  
- Corresponding CSV datasets utilized in these notebooks.  
- Documentation within notebooks clarifies the usage of each file.

## How to Run the Notebooks

- Open the relevant folder based on the dataset (EN or TR).  
- Open the notebook(s) of interest in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.  
- Make sure the CSV files referenced in the notebook are present in the same folder or update the file paths accordingly in the code cells.  
- Follow the instructions and comments within the notebooks for executing the code step-by-step.

## Notes

- The CSV files contain the data required to train and test the machine learning models.  
- The notebooks include detailed markdown explanations and code comments to help understand each step of the process.  
- Ensure all files remain in their respective folders to maintain correct relative paths when running the notebooks.
