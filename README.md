Social Media-Based Misinformation Detection Using Machine Learning Models

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the code and datasets developed as part of my dissertation project on detecting misinformation using machine learning techniques applied to social media text data.

---

## Dataset

All datasets required for running the notebooks are included within the repository folders alongside the respective code files.

## Folder Structure and Contents

### 1. `7150CEM_SAIANIRUDH_EN_DATA_CODE`  
This folder contains all English (EN) language related files including:  
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) implementing data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for the English dataset.  
- CSV data files used by the notebooks for training and testing the models.  
- Each notebook contains markdown cells describing its purpose and the associated CSV files it requires.

### 2. `7150CEM_SAIANIRUDH_TR_DATA_CODE`  
This folder contains all turkish (TR) language related dataset files including:  
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments involving translated or alternative language data.  
- Corresponding CSV datasets utilized in these notebooks.  
- Documentation within notebooks clarifies the usage of each file.

## How to Run the Notebooks

- Open the relevant folder based on the dataset (EN or TR).
- Before running any English (EN) notebook, ensure all the required CSV files are placed in the same folder as the notebook. This is necessary so the code can properly locate and load the data files.
- For example, if you are running the notebook from the folder 7150CEM_SAIANIRUDH_EN_DATA_CODE in Google Colab, you must upload all related CSV and notebook files to the same Colab workspace folder before    executing the code.
- Open the notebooks of interest in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
- If you move the CSV files elsewhere, update the file paths in the notebook code accordingly.

## Notes

- The CSV files contain the data required to train and test the machine learning models.  
- The notebooks include detailed markdown explanations and code comments to help understand each step of the process.  
- Ensure all files remain in their respective folders to maintain correct relative paths when running the notebooks.
